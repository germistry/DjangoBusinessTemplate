# DjangoBusinessTemplate
This is a django generic template I made for any business or organization website. It has common data structures for types of content that generally appear on these sorts of websites.
I use this template to quickly create working websites for clients. 

The front end is based off a generic html template, as using a html template and simply customising it to reflect the branding or image of the client significantly reduces design time.

More details on how I went about designing and creating this template can be found in [my portfolio](https://germistry.com/Portfolio/3/django-small-business-website-template).
